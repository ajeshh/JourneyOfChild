Journey Of Child
================

It's hard to imagine a child's life in another country at times when one cannot imagine living there, or knowing what kind of life choices are available if any. One of the biggest challenges is to understand just how much the numbers are stacked against a child surviving past the age of 14, without suffering from malnutrition, not possessing the ability or freedom to finish school, having very limited access to resources, at times forced into labor just to survive and then finally the worst case of dying before their time.

This app is to help understand the different situations faced by a child in different countries.

My long term goal is to develop a game that challenge kids and adults to find ways to survive in different hostile situations that children face in the real world.
